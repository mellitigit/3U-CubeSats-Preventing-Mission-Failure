    "## Goal\n",
    "Build a custom Gym environment to simulate the CubeSat and use the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm to learn a smart control policy for detumbling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "1. **CubeSatEnv**: Simplified simulation of spacecraft attitude dynamics\n",
    "2. **Detector Model**: Use the model trained in `cubesat.ipynb` to shape the reward\n",
    "3. **SAC Agent**: Advanced reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous actions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applied Improvements\n",
    "✅ Robust model loading  \n",
    "✅ Fixed random seeds  \n",
    "✅ Added maximum steps  \n",
    "✅ Increased training steps  \n",
    "✅ Added Callbacks and TensorBoard  \n",
    "✅ Comprehensive evaluation of the trained policy  "
